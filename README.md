This repository contains code to build and deploy a machine learning
model that predicts customer churn for a telecommunications company
using the Marimo framework. The model is trained on the well known
IBM Telco Customer Churn dataset.


## The Model

The model is logistic regression model built using `scikit-learn`.

The model currently uses the following features:
- `tenure`: Number of months the customer has stayed with the company.
- `MonthlyCharges`: The amount charged to the customer monthly.
- `TechSupport_yes`: Binary indicator of whether the customer has tech support.
- `Contract_month-to-month`: Binary indicator of whether the customer has month-to-month contract.
- `InternetService_fiber`: Binary indicator of whether the customer has tech fiber internet service.

We compared logistic regression, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting model to find a best model for the prediction, while Random Forest and Gradient Boosting show marginal improvements over Logistic Regression, we have chosen to move forward with Logistic Regression for the following reasons:

### Performance:
Logistic Regression achieves almost similar performance (within 1-2% of ensemble methods)
The marginal performance gains from more complex models do not justify added complexity

### Interpretability:
Logistic Regression provides clear, interpretable coefficients
Easy to explain feature importance and churn drivers to stakeholders

### Computational Efficiency:
Significantly faster training and inference
Lower memory footprint for deployment
Easier to maintain and update in production


The model is built and trained using `notebooks/telco_marimo.py`. The model is
saved in the `models/` directory, with the scaler and model bundled together
using `joblib`.

An example prediction can be found in `prediction.py`.

## CI Pipeline

There is a CI pipeline set up using GitHub Actions that runs tests
on every push and pull request. The tests are located in the `tests/`
directory and can be run locally using `pytest`.

# Deploying to Serverless

The saved model can deployment to an Azure Function with the following
steps:


1. **In your Codespace**, install the Azure Function extension:
    - Open the Extensions view in the left sidebar.
    - Search for "Azure Functions" and install the extension by Microsoft.

2. **In your Codespace**, create the function:
    - Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).
    - Type and select *Azure Functions: Create Function*
         - Do not select the "...in Azure..." command
    - Select the root folder of the project (should be the default).
    - Select *Python* as the language.
    - Select *HTTP trigger* as the template.
    - Provide a name (without spaces or special characters) e.g. predict.
    - Select *FUNCTION* as the authorization level.
    - **Do not** *overwrite* the `.gitignore` file.

3. **In your Codespace**, wait some time for the function to be created. Then:
    - Add azure.functions to your env with `uv add azure-functions`
    - Update the `requirements.txt` file for Azure `uv pip freeze > requirements.txt`
    - Edit the `function_app.py` file
        - Add an import: `from prediction import make_prediction`
        - Replace the line `name = req.params.get('name')`,
        using the same approach to get input data for prediction.
            - You'll need tenure, monthly bill and tech support status.
            - It is up to you how you name these but simple names are best.
            - The variable name (on the left) is internal to the function,
            while the string name (on the right) is what the user will need to provide.
                ```python
                tenure = req.params.get('tenure')
                monthly = req.params.get('monthly')
                techsupport = req.params.get('techsupport')
                ```
        - Remove the entire `if not name:` block. We aren't supporting JSON input here.
        - Call the `make_prediction` function, passing tenure, monthly and techsupport
        as keyword arguments following the column names used by the model:
            ```python
            prediction = make_prediction(
                tenure=tenure,
                MonthlyCharges=monthly,
                TechSupport_yes=techsupport
            )
            ```
        - Change `if name:` to `if tenure and monthly and techsupport:`
        - Change the `f""` response to return the prediction result instead of a name.
    - **Commit and Sync** all your changes!

4. **In the Azure Portal**, create a Azure Function App.
    - Choose *Flex Consumption*.
    - Select your existing **Resource Group**.
    - Choose a unique **name** for your Function App.
    - Set the **Region** to a supported student region (e.g. *Switzerland North*).
    - Choose *Python* *3.12* / *3.13* as the **runtime** stack and **version**.
    - Choose the smallest **instance size** (e.g. *512MB*).
    - If given the option, *disable* **Zone Redundancy**.
    - Use an existing **Storage Account** or create a new one.
    - *Configure* **diagnostic settings** *now*, leaving the default.
    - Leave the *defaults* for OpenAI (disable)
    - Leave the *defaults* for Networking (public enabled, virtual disabled).
    - Leave the *defaults* for Monitoring (enable in a supported region).
    - Enable **Continuous Deployment** and point to your repo, signing in to GitHub.
    - Enable **Basic Authentication**.
    - Leave the *defaults* for Authentication (secrets) and tags (none).
    - Wait until the deployment completes.

5. **In the Codespace**, in **Source Control**, click on the *Pull* icon,
or chose it through the `...` menu.
    - Ensure you have the latest changes from GitHub (a new workflow file)
        - If not, click *Pull* again until you do.
    - Edit the **newly** created workflow file in `.github/workflows/`
    i.e. not the existing `quality.yaml`
        - Find the `Install dependencies` step and add `-t .` to the commmand:
        
            ```yaml
            run: pip install -r requirements.txt -t .
            ```
        - Find the `Deploy to Azure Functions` and add `sku: 'flexconsumption' to the with block:
        
            ```yaml
            ...
            with:
              sku: 'flexconsumption'
              app-name: ...
            ```
    - **Commit and Sync** all your changes!

6. **On your repository on GitHub**, go to the *Actions* tab.
    - Wait for the workflow to complete successfully.

7. **In the Azure Portal**, navigate to your Function App.
    - Select your function from the list.
    - Test the function using the *Test/Run* option in the Function
        - Provide the required parameters (tenure, monthly, techsupport)
        - Run the test and check the output for the prediction result.
