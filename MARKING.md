# C++

Excellent work selecting new features and re-training the model.
A nice frontend using classic UI elements in streamlit. Good use
of a few new elements beyond what was shown in class. The Docker CI
pipeline is working well, however it packages the Marimo notebook,
while it should package your Streamlit frontend. Good efforts to
enable deployment of the Azure Function; Streamlit app not being in
a Docker container will impact on deployment.

Great commit history showing a mostly balanced distribution of
efforts in preparing the repository. Great work on preparing a
very nice set of documentation pages and having them deployed
automatically with GitHub Actions. Efforts to prepare a FastAPI
app, but not Docker-ised or deployed to Azure Functions.
